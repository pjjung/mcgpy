# Time Series Data

Magnetocardiography (MCG) devices are measurement systems of time-varying magnetic fields generated by the heart activity. Cardiac magnetic signals are recorded with multi-sensors designed to sense the weak magnetic fields (almost $$10 fT$$-$$10 pT$$). Then, the primary data structure of MCG is the time-stream array of magnetic fields at different locations. The data obtained from each sensor is commonly called the channel.

## The TimeSeries

```python
from mcgpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
```

MCGpy provides the [TimeSeries]() class which creates the time series data with metadata and reads a single data from raw files. Since this object is based on [numpy.ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) and [astropy.units.Quantity](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/quantity.html), [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) users might be easy to learn how to use it.

There are the available source formats:

| Format  | Read     | Write     | Auto identify     | 
| ------- | -------- | --------- | ----------------- | 
| KDF     | Yes      | No        | Yes               |
| HDF5    | Yes      | will be supported| Yes        |
| CSV     | -        | -         |                   |
| TXT     | -        | -         |                   |

For examples, to create a simple [TimeSeries]() by a ramdom data, and to read a channel data from a frame file:

### User defined dataset

```python
>>> from mcgpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
>>> import numpy as np
>>> source = np.random.random(100)
>>> data = TimeSeries(source)
>>> print(data)
<TimeSeries [0.15538315, 0.37469937, 0.25495241, ..., 0.25465358, 0.65668087] 1e-15 T>
```

[TimeSeries]() contains several properties to show metadata:

| Properties  | Description                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| unit        | The physical unit of the data |
| t0          | |
| dt          | |
| sample_rate | |
| times       | |


### KDF format

```python
>>> from mcgpy.timeseries import TimeSeries


```

### HDF5 format

```python
>>> from mcgpy.timeseries import TimeSeries


```
