# Time Series Data

Magnetocardiography (MCG) devices are measurement systems of time-varying magnetic fields generated by the heart activity. Cardiac magnetic signals are recorded with multi-sensors designed to sense the weak magnetic fields (almost $$10 fT$$-$$10 pT$$). Then, the primary data structure of MCG is the time-stream array of magnetic fields at different locations. The data obtained from each sensor is commonly called the channel.
