# MCGpy docs

Magnetocardiography (MCG) is recordings of the magnetic fields with respect to cardiac electrical activity in noninvasive and contactless ways. To sense and localize current dipole sources on the surface of the heart, most MCG systems are composed of multi-array channels, using extremely sensitive devices, in which MCG mapping can provide promising results in locating various intracardiac sources with them. All of the analysis and diagnosis require complex calculations, not only to get a current distribution from time-series datasets but also to study the device's behavior.

MCGpy is a Python package to study and analyze the magnetocardiographic signals and divieces. It contains algorithms that can read MCG datasets and calculate cardiac magnetic fields without knowing detailed background information. This package is a free software, though. If you use MCGpy in your scientific or medical publications, please contact and ask for acknowledgment of this work.
